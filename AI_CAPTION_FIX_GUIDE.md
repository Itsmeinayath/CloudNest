# AI Caption Generation Fix - Manual Testing Guide

## What was Fixed

The AI caption generation was failing due to several issues:

1. **Invalid Model Name**: The code was using `"gemini-1.5-flash-latest"` which is not a valid Gemini model name
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited error logging made it difficult to debug issues
3. **No Fallback Support**: If one model failed, the entire feature would fail

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Model Names
- Changed from `"gemini-1.5-flash-latest"` to stable models
- Added fallback support for multiple models: `"gemini-1.5-pro"`, `"gemini-1.5-flash"`, `"gemini-pro-vision"`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed error logging with status codes and messages
- Improved input validation for image URLs and MIME types
- Better error responses to help with debugging

### 3. Improved Debugging
- Added console logging for successful model connections
- Enhanced response structure logging
- Better error reporting in the FileUploadForm component

## Manual Testing Instructions

To test that AI captions are working again:

1. **Set up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Make sure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should not be empty
   ```

2. **Test the Upload Flow**
   - Navigate to the file upload section of CloudNest
   - Upload an image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)
   - Watch for the "Generating AI caption..." status message
   - Verify that a caption is generated and saved with the file

3. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - Look for successful connection messages: `"Successfully connected using model: gemini-1.5-pro"`
   - If there are errors, the new logging should provide detailed information

4. **Test Error Scenarios**
   - Try uploading a non-image file to verify it doesn't attempt caption generation
   - Test with a malformed URL (if testing the API directly)

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case
- Upload progress shows "Uploading..." → "Generating AI caption..." → "Upload successful!"
- Console shows: `"Successfully connected using model: [model-name]"`
- Console shows: `"AI caption generated successfully: [caption text]"`
- File is saved with the generated caption as its description

### Fallback Case
- If first model fails, it automatically tries the next one
- Console shows warnings for failed models and success for the working one
- Caption generation still succeeds as long as at least one model works

### Error Case
- If all models fail, shows "AI caption failed, but file was saved"
- Console shows detailed error information for debugging
- File is still uploaded successfully, just without an AI caption

## API Endpoint Testing

You can also test the caption generation API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/gemini/generate-caption \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageUrl": "https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg"}' \
  --cookie "your-auth-cookie"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "caption": "A descriptive caption of the image content."
}
```
